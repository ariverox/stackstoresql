# stackstoresql
Simples store project with sql,react, and redux to hammer down the basics

#why?
I took a coding bootcamp a couple of months ago and we had a store project.
By far store project helped really work through the nitty gritty of CRUD apps
the most, both from a backend and front end perspective.
You can learn a lot about implementing all sorts of thing by making a store from scratch

In that version we used mongo, angular and cookies.
This time I want to get used to using React, Redux, JSON web tokens, and Postgres

with potentially some Redis
